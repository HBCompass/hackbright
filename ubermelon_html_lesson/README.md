ubermelon_html_lesson
=====================

##Instructions
Take a look at ubermelon_screenshot.png. Make a webpage that looks like this screenshot using HTML and CSS. You will also need to use ubermelonsmall.png, and you can get some Lorem Ipsum [here](http://www.lipsum.com/) (or [here](http://hipsum.co/) or [here!](https://github.com/laurakelly/melon_ipsum)) for the text.

**DO NOT** look at index.html or main.css just yet!

##Extra Credit
1. If you haven't tried this already, make your CSS style sheet externally linked with a link tag.
2. Clone this repo and open up index.html with a browser (**NOT** Sublime). What happens when you hover over the text at the bottom? What happens when you click on one of those items? Duplicate that behavior.
3. Now resize your browser window. See how the image and columns change size? That's called responsive design. Make your web page resize in the same way.
4. If you're feeling fancy, try to use a custom font from Google Fonts.
5. Extra extra credit: build this page using Twitter Bootstrap.
