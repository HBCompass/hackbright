Oh Sussudio I just say the word
Oh Sussudio I'll say the word
Sussudio oh oh oh
Just say the word

Why can't they understand the way we feel?
They just don't trust what they can't explain
I know we're different but deep inside us
We're not that different at all

I don't want to be your babysitter
You're a very big boy now
I don't want to be your mother
I didn't carry you in my womb for nine months
Show me the back door

'Cause you'll be in my heart
Yes, you'll be in my heart
Believe me, you'll be in my heart

I wish nothing but the best for you both
An older version of me
Is she perverted like me
Would she go down on you in a theatre
Does she speak eloquently

It's not fair to deny me
Of the cross I bear that you gave to me
You, you, you oughta know

I hate to bug you in the middle of dinner
It was a slap in the face how quickly I was replaced
Are you thinking of me when you fuck her?


Visiting hours are 9 to 5 and if I show up at 10 past 6
Well I already know that you'd find some way to sneak me in and oh
Mind the empty bottle with the holes along the bottom
You see it's too much to ask for and I am not the doctor

You live you learn
You love 
You cry 
You lose 
You bleed 
You scream 

I can feel it coming in the air tonight, oh Lord
I can feel it coming in the air tonight, oh Lord, oh Lord, oh Lord

There's this girl that's been on my mind
All the time, Sussudio oh oh
Now she don't even know my name
But I think she likes me just the same
Sussudio oh oh

Don't listen to them
'Cause what do they know?  
We need each other
To have, to hold.
They'll see in time
I know

When destiny calls you
You must be strong 
I may not be with you
But you've got to hold on
They'll see in time
I know
We'll show them together
