I can feel it coming in the air tonight, oh Lord
And I've been waiting for this moment for all my life, Oh Lord
Well I remember, I remember don't worry
Sussudio oh oh 
Oh Sussudio, oh
Oh Sussudio
I'll show her anytime
Sussudio just say the word
You live you learn
You love you learn
And I'm here to remind you
Of the mess you left when you went away
It's not fair to deny me
Of the cross I bear that you gave to me
You, you, you oughta know
