Exercise 03 - Problem Solving
=============================

__Congratulations!__ Your test results must have caught the eye of someone high up, because you're being promoted to __Problem Solver__! Today, we're going to be writing some basic code for use in a top-secret melon-oriented program whose purpose is [INFORMATION REDACTED]. I'm sure you grasp the importance of this project, and that writing error-free code is paramount. Test data is given, but I'm sure there are more cases you might be able to think of. 

###Your Assignment###

Given an array in Javascript, ***write a function that returns any items in the array that are duplicated***.
The data contained in the array may be an integer or a string, or a boolean, but it will not be an array or a javascript object.

Here's some test data:

```javascript
var votesToGoEatCake = [true, true, true, true]

// Should return in no particular order:
// [true]

```

```javascript
var hackbrightStudents = ["katie", "amy", "jenny", "katie", "kelley", "katie", "amy"]

// Should return in no particular order:
// ["katie", "amy"]

```

```javascript

var classroomIds = ["47","12", "19", "22", "26", "99", "30", "50", "324", "003", "44",
    "33", "346", "354", "44", "235", "45", "34", "44", "590", "09", "099", "0", "1", "3", 
    "33", "999", "9"]


// Should return in no particular order:
// ["44", "33"]
```

```javascript 
var randomJunkIFound = ["katie", "true", true, 19, "gargoyles", "!", 2 + 3, "2 + 3", 
    19, "19", 19 === "19", 6, false, false]

// Should return in no particular order:
// [19, false]

```
