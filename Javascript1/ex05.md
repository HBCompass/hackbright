Exercise 05 - Advanced Reading List
================================

Today we're creating a reading list!  
First, let's talk more about Objects!  

We've seen objects and methods before in python. We first thought of them as dictionaries, instead of as classes. Turns out, Javascript has classes as well, but they look very different. They also behave slightly different. We don't have inheritance the same way, and we don't define methods, or initialization the same way. There's lots of stuff that's familiar but presented differently.  

We'll start out by just using the equivalent of dictionaries that contain functions, and functions that can have properties. Let's get started.  
  

The first thing we're going to be dealing with is the Book List itself. Book lists are complex, and need to be "set up" before they can be used. Normally, we'd declare an `__init__()` function on an object, and that would get run whenever we set up a new copy of the object.

We don't have any of that fancy stuff in Javascript, we just have Objects (dictionaries), and those Objects can have Properties (keys with values). Properties can be anything, including Functions. Functions are Objects too (wat.), so they can have their own Properties. (Feel free to become upset by this.)

So, when you think of an object in Javascript, think of this:
```javascript
var myHouse = {
	roommates: ['Janardan', 'KF', 'Rebecca', 'Elli', 'Meeko'],
	sqFootage: 1400,
	rent: "Too Damn Much"
}
```
Which is basically:
```javascript
{
	property: value,
	property: value,
	property: value
}
```

BUT WAIT, THERE'S MORE.  
So, what about setting properties up whenever you create an object? After all, the objects above can't be copied easily, and we can't think of them as Classes very easily, can we? How do we template? How do we create instances?

Let's think. What _is_ a class? It's just a template for an object - all cats have fur, but what color is it? All starfleet ships have a designation, but it differs from ship to ship. Objects are _instances_ of some class, but Javascript doesn't _have_ classes, does it?  

Javascript might not really have classes, but as we've probably mentioned, it's very permissive. We can abuse technicalities to make it do what we want, and it will oblige well enough.  

In Javascript functions, we get a special variable called `this`. It refers to the "calling context", which I'll explain in a minute. Let's get our hands dirty with this:

```javascript
var StarShip = function(designation, registryNumber, crewComplement){
	this.designation = designation || "Unknown Designation";
	this.registryNumber = registryNumber || "registryNumber";
	this.crewComplement = crewComplement || 0;
}
```
Which is basically just:

```javascript
var ClassName = function(property, property){
	this.property = property || defaultValue;
	this.property = property || defaultValue;
}
```
(As an aside, that `property || defaultValue;` syntax is a way to set default values. It has to do with lazy evaluation - the second part never runs if the first part has some kind of value set.)

So, how do we use this? We can create a few starships like this:
```javascript
var enterprise = new StarShip("Enterprise", "NCC-1701-D", 1014);

var birdOfPrey = new StarShip("IKS Koraga", "K'Vort", "25")

```

Whenever we use the "new" keyword, this is a shortcut. What happens underneath is essentially the function returns /itself/, but as an object. Go ahead and console.log our ships, and see what's happened.  

This is where that `this` variable comes into play - essentially, it's a bit like `self` in Python - it doesn't refer to the class where it's being defined, it's refering to the instance itself. Whenever you make a copy of an object with `new`, `this` gets pointed at the instance/copy of the object, instead of the original function we defined. If you're defining a function that isn't inside of an object, `this` will refer to the global context. Try it by console.log-ing `this` in different places.

Doing it like this is called using the **constructor invocation pattern**, which is basically using JS in an object-oriented way.


TL;DR - do this stuff:  

Create a class for a Book through the constructor invocation pattern. `Book = function() {}`  
- Each book should have several properties:  
	- Title
	- Genre
	- Author
	- Read (true or false)
	- Read date, can be blank, otherwise needs to be a JS Date() object


Create a class for your booklist through the constructor invocation pattern. `BookList = function() {}`
- BookLists should have the following properties:
	- Number of books marked as read (eg, BookList.booksRead)
	- Number of books marked not read yet
	- An array of all the Books (eg. BookList.bookShelf - is an array.)

- Booklists should have methods that can do or return the following things:
	- add(book) - should add a book to the books list.
	- finishCurrentBook - should find the current book you're reading, mark it as read, give it a "read" date (of right now) and then change the next book in the queue to be the current book. It should also change the "next book" pointer to a random book that hasn't been read yet.  
	- Last book read(book object)
	- Current book being read (book object)
	- A pointer to the next book to read (a book object)(eg, BookList.nextBook() - returns a Book)

Booklists and Books might need more methods than that. Feel free to experiment with making your book list more useful or interesting.
