Trial 6: Mixing and mixing
=========================
We're doing basically the same thing as before, but this time, everything is horizontal.

Expected tags
-------------
* [html](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/html)
* [head](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/head)
* [style](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/style)
* [body](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/body)
* [div (6)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/div)

Expected css styles
-------------------
* [display: inline-block](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/display)
* [margin-top](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/margin-top)
* [margin-left](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/margin-left)

Style notes
-----------
* The left bar is red
* The right bar is blue
* The inner boxes are black

Layout notes
------------
* The two horizontally stacked bars are 400x200 px
* The inner boxes are all 100x100 px
* The inner boxes are evenly spaced from the edges of the outer boxes
* **Important!** In our screenshot, there is no gap between the left and the right bar. Figure out how to do this. (Hint: this is not a CSS problem)
