Trial 9: The Fanciest Form
==========================
Tying all of it together, we're going to add a little layout to the form from the previous trial. Use some of the tricks you learned about sizing things while stacking them horizontally to clean up the way the form is displayed.

Expected tags
-------------
* [html](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/html)
* [head](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/head)
* [style](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/style)
* [body](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/body)
* [h1](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/Heading_Elements)
* [form](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/form)
* [label (3)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/label)
* [input (6)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input)
* [select](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/select)
* [option (5)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/option)
* [div (7)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/div)

General Notes
-------------
* If you used `<br>` tags in the previous trial, get rid of them and use `<div>` tags to force things to stack vertically. You should never use linebreaks to change the layout of elements.
