Trial 7: The Basic Form
=======================
`input` tags are HTML elements that are meant to be interacted with. The most basic input tag is the text input, where a user can type directly into a single-line box.

Forms are collections of related input tags. Input tags should always be placed inside a `form` tag.

We can use `label` tags to attach a label to an input tag. Mostly, a label is indistinguishable from regular text. However, clicking on a label that is correctly attached to an input will cause the browser to activate that input (the cursor will appear in the input tag).

```
<label for="my-input-tag">My Label</label>
<input type="text" name="my-input-tag"></input>
```

Submit buttons, oddly, are not a separate tag type. They are simply an `input` tag of type 'submit'.
