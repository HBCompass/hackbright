Trial 4: The Flag Returns
=========================
Given the previous exercise, it is unnatural to force divs to stack up next to each other horizontally. However, 'inline' elements such as spans do this naturally, but refuse to allow us to change their size and shape. 

We can get the best of both worlds by marking an element as an `inline-block`. This gives us an element we can reshape but stacks horizontally instead of vertically against other inline elements by default.

Use this mechanism to build an Italian flag.
