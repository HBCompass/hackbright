Trial 3: The Flag
====================
As a block element, the natural behavior of the div is to stack on top of other block elements. We'll abuse this behavior to create a German flag.

Expected tags
-------------
* [html](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/html)
* [head](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/head)
* [style](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/style)
* [body](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/body)
* [div (3)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/div)

Style notes
-----------
* The top bar is black
* The middle bar is red
* The bottom bar is 'gold', defined as #ffd700

Layout notes
------------
* Each of the bars is the same thickness
* The width of the flag is 500px
* The width-to-height ratio of the flag is 5 to 3.

General notes
-------------
You will want to do some research about "class" and "id" selectors.
