Trial 2: The Red Div
====================
For our purposes, the div is the basic unit of layout in HTML. To make it really useful, we first need to bend it to our will. The first steps towards that are fixing it in size, shape and color. Place a basic red div on your page.

Style Notes
-----------
* The background color of the div is a solid red, #FF0000 in hex

Layout Notes
------------
* The dimensions of the div are 350x240px
* Notice that the div is flush against the window's edge. Try to match that. (Hint: it is the margin of a different element that offsets the box from the window edge)
