Trial 10: Columns!
==========================
When we have horizontally stacked items of different heights aligned by their top edge, we need something a little more heavy duty than `inline-block` elements. Inline blocks don't give sufficient control to easily do columnar layouts.

Instead, we resort to the following trick. First, start with two divs with no layout applied, as in this screen shot. In our example, Box A will eventually end up on the right side.

Next, apply a styling of `position: absolute;` to Box A. It will temporarily cover Box B.

Finally, apply a `margin-left` to Box A, equal or greater to the width of Box B. In our example, Box B is 110px and we've applied a left margin of 120px to Box A.

Use this technique to produce the layout below, using your fanciest form from the previous exercise.

Style Notes
-----------
* Both boxes have a background color of light grey, #cccccc in hex
* The list in the left box is an unordered list using the default bullet set.

Layout Notes
------------
* Both layout boxes are 300px wide.
* Both boxes have an inner padding of 5px to keep the contents from being flush with the edge of the box.
* The box on the left is 200px high.
* The box on the right is 175px high.

General Notes
-------------
* `position: absolute` is a little fiddly to play around with. Getting the boxes to align across their top margins without extra work requires that the box on the left be placed **after** the box that goes on the right, in terms of where the HTML is written.
