Trial 5: Mixing and matching
=========================
We're going to mix and match both the horizontal and vertical stacking behavior in this exercise.

Using divs, create two vertically stacked divs. Inside each of these divs, place two horizontally adjacent divs.

As you do this, use the css margin to make sure things are evenly spaced.
